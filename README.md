## Introduction

- Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software system are tested independently to ensure that they are working as expected. A unit can be a small piece of code, a single function or method, or a module.
- The primary goal of unit testing is to identify and isolate defects in individual units of code before they are integrated into the larger system. This approach allows developers to catch and fix errors early in the development process, reducing the cost and time required for testing and debugging the entire system.
- Unit tests are usually automated, meaning that they are written as code and run automatically as part of a continuous integration (CI) process. The results of the tests are then reported to developers, who can use them to improve the quality of their code.
- Overall, unit testing is an essential practice in software development that helps ensure the reliability, maintainability, and quality of software systems.

## What includes in Unit Testing

- Functional Testing: This type of testing focuses on testing the functionality of a single unit or component. It checks whether the unit behaves as expected, based on its inputs and outputs.
- Boundary Testing: This type of testing focuses on testing the boundary conditions of a unit. It checks how the unit behaves when its inputs are at the edge of their allowed values or when the unit is pushed beyond its limits.
- Error Handling Testing: This type of testing focuses on testing how a unit handles errors or exceptions. It checks whether the unit handles errors gracefully and whether it provides meaningful error messages to users.
- Performance Testing: This type of testing focuses on testing the performance of a unit. It checks how the unit performs under different loads and stress levels.
- Security Testing: This type of testing focuses on testing the security of a unit. It checks whether the unit is vulnerable to attacks and whether it adheres to security best practices.
